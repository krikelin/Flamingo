        <h1>Personal Spotify Apps 2.0 technology proposal (Inofficial)</h1>

<p><em>Please note this proposal is NOT endosered by Spotify, and all opinions stated in the written code and docs is subject to me, and that I'm not a employer of Spotify (but I'd like to be it) and this functionality mentioned here is NOT working in Spotify app and may not be implemented at all, this is a prototype of my suggestions for a future version of Spotify Apps 2.0 only.</em></p>

<p><strong>Please note that the code here is not intended for be used within Spotify apps, the code in this repository is only for demonstrating the functionality I propose. I take no responsibility if someone try to run it in Spotify and the consequences of it</strong></p>

<p>This app is showcasing a suggestion of technical updates to Spotify App I have to a major update. Among these suggestion includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to allow users to subscribe certain views (defined by the App manifest) of an app and recieve updates related to them</li>
<li>Ability to in-place filter in app-views like in Library, Artist view etc. with CTRL+F</li>
<li>Ability to send a certain app view to a another user, if the app is live.</li>
<li>Ability to define 'tracklist' views like the playlist view, with a regular playlist list. Events related to them is handled in JavaScript</li>
</ul><h1>Functionality</h1>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<p>This feature will allow people to subscribe to a certain playlist. To do it this declaration is applied to the manifest</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>To this functionality, I hook up with two events, EVENT.SUBSCRIBE and EVENT.UNSUBSCRIBE on the application event object. These is raised when a user subscribe to a view and is handled in this way:</p>

<p>script.js</p>

<pre><code>...
/**
* Raises when a user subscribes to a certain view in the app (as defined in the manifest)
* e = {
*       uri = the current uri to subscribe,
*       parameters = parameters
    specials = the special parameters %s1, %s2
*   }
*/
models.application.observe(models.EVENT.SUBSCRIBE, function(e){
    var uri = e.uri; // The uri to the view
    var parameters = e.parameters; // the parameters to the view, %s123 split in a array
    var user = e.user; // The spotify user name
    // This is a just a though of a certain concept to register
    var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open("GET", "http://api.someservice.td/playlist/" + parameters[0] +"/add_subscriber?user="+user+"&amp;api_key=07d8c79613718f5c3967da37db79978c");
    xmlHttp.send(null);

    // In this way services could see how many people who is intereset of the app
    /**
     * This can be used to track the amount of subscribed people to a certain view inside an app,
     * with your own backend...
     */
});

/**
* Raises when a user unsubscribes from certain view in the app (as defined in the manifest)
* The removal of the view from the sidebar is done by spotify, this callback is used to raise app-specific events related
* to a users unsubscription of a certain app state.
* e = {
*       uri = the current uri to subscribe,
*       
*/
models.application.observe(models.EVENT.UNSUBSCRIBE, function(e){
    var uri = e.uri; // The uri to the view
    var parameters = e.parameters; // the parameters to the view, %s123 split in a array
    var user = e.user; // The spotify user name
    // This is a just a though of a certain concept to register
    var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open("GET", "http://api.someservice.td/playlist/" + parameters[0] +"/remove_subscriber?user="+user+"&amp;api_key=07d8c79613718f5c3967da37db79978c");
    xmlHttp.send(null);

    // In this way services could see how many people who is intereset of the app
});

models.application.observe(models.EVENT.ARGUMENTSCHANGED, function() {
    // If we are in section djMix, temporary enable cross fading (DJ Mix),
    // Enabling cross fading will also temporary enable gapless playback, but only for the view.
    var args = models.application.arguments;
    if(args.length &gt; 0&amp;&amp; args[1] == "djmix") {
        models.application.player.crossFade = models.CROSSFADE;

    } else {
        models.application.player.crossFade = false // Set to the global settings
    }
});
#Send apps to people
For live apps, I would like a functionality to be able to send apps to other people, and this should be optional and set by the developer in the manifest.json

 ...
 "AllowSendToFriend" : true, 
 ...

Also, when a app is sent to a people, an additonal event is also invoked:

 ...
 /***
 * Proposal listener for sharing the app view to a certain people:
 * NOTE Requires AllowSendToFriend property set to true in manifest.json
 */
 models.application.observe(models.EVENT.SEND_TO_PEOPLE, function(e) {
    var uri = e.uri; // The uri to the view
    var parameters = e.parameters; // the parameters to the view, %s123 split in a array
    var user = e.user; // The spotify user name
    var target = e.receipiant; 
    /**
    When implementing this functionality, take the security in consideration when it coming to register
    the receipiant in the app. In the test-app mode, the event won't send it to any people at all, but raise the
    event as usual.
    */
 });
