I take no responsibility if someone try to run it in Spotify and the consequences of it**\r\n \r\n\r\nThis app is showcasing a suggestion of technical updates to Spotify App I have to a major update. Among these suggestion includes:\r\n\r\n* Ability to allow users to subscribe certain views (defined by the App manifest) of an app and recieve updates related to them\r\n* Ability to in-place filter in app-views like in Library, Artist view etc. with CTRL+F\r\n* Ability to send a certain app view to a another user, if the app is live.\r\n* Ability to define 'tracklist' views like the playlist view, with a regular playlist list. Events related to them is handled in JavaScript\r\n\r\n#Functionality\r\n\r\n##Subscriptions\r\nThis feature will allow people to subscribe to a certain playlist.
