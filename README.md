==Personal Spotify Apps 2.0 technology proposal (Inofficial)
This app is showcasing a suggestion of technical updates to Spotify App I have to a major update. Among these suggestion includes:
 * Ability to allow users to subscribe certain views (defined by the App manifest) of an app and recieve updates related to them
 * Ability to in-place filter in app-views like in Library, Artist view etc. with CTRL+F
 * Ability to send a certain app view to a another user, if the app is live.
 * Ability to define 'tracklist' views like the playlist view, with a regular playlist list. Events related to them is handled in JavaScript
Please note this proposal is NOT endosered by Spotify, and all opinions stated in the written code and docs is subject to me, and that I'm not a employer of Spotify (but I'd like it)
 and this functionality mentioned here is NOT working in Spotify app and may not be implemented at all, this is a prototype of my suggestions for a future version of Spotify Apps 2.0 only.
