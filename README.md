#Personal Spotify Apps 2.0 technology proposal (Inofficial)
*Please note this proposal is NOT endosered by Spotify, and all opinions stated in the written code and docs is subject to me, and that I'm not a employer of Spotify (but I'd like to be it) and this functionality mentioned here is NOT working in Spotify app and may not be implemented at all, this is a prototype of my suggestions for a future version of Spotify Apps 2.0 only.*
***Please note that the code here is not intended for be used within Spotify apps, the code in this repository is only for demonstrating the functionality I propose. I take no responsibility if someone try to run it in Spotify and the consequences of it**
 

This app is showcasing a suggestion of technical updates to Spotify App I have to a major update. Among these suggestion includes:

* Ability to allow users to subscribe certain views (defined by the App manifest) of an app and recieve updates related to them
* Ability to in-place filter in app-views like in Library, Artist view etc. with CTRL+F
* Ability to send a certain app view to a another user, if the app is live.
* Ability to define 'tracklist' views like the playlist view, with a regular playlist list. Events related to them is handled in JavaScript
